class Image:
    """
    The generic Image object, containing attributes and methods for calculating
    and manipulating images.
    This is the base class used for both particle and parametric images,
    containing the functionality common to both. Images can be made with or
    without a PSF and noise.

    Attributes:
        psfs (array-like/dict, float/array_like, float)
            Either A single array describing a PSF to be used on all images or

            {filter_code: PSF} key-value pair structure.
        filters (FilterCollection)
            An imutable collection of Filter objects. If provided, images are
            made for each filter.

        imgs (dict, array-like, float)
            A dictionary containing filter_code keys and img values. Only used
            if a FilterCollection is passed.
        imgs_psf (dict, array-like, float)
            A dictionary containing filter_code keys and images with PSF as
            values. Only used if a FilterCollection is passed.

            A dictionary containing filter_code keys and images with noise as
            values. Only used if a FilterCollection is passed.

            An RGB image. (npix, npix, 3)
        combined_imgs (list)

            make a composite image object.
        depths (float/dict, float)
            The depth of this observation. Can either be a single value or a
            value per filter in a dictionary.
        snrs (float/dict, float)
            The desired signal to noise of this observation. Assuming a
            signal-to-noise ratio of the form SN R= S / N = S / sqrt(sigma).
            Can either be a single SNR or a SNR per filter in a dictionary.
        apertures (float/dict, float)
            The radius of the aperture depth is defined in, if not a point
            source depth, in the same units as the image resolution. Can either
            be a single radius or a radius per filter in a dictionary.
        weight_map (array-like, float)
            The pixel weight map used for noise application. Only used if a
            single image is made.
