        Get a LineCollection containing lines attenuated by a simple screen.

        Calculates attenuated properties (luminosity, continuum, EW) for a set
        of lines assuming a simple dust screen (i.e. both nebular and stellar
        emission feels the same dust attenuation). This is a wrapper around
        the more general method above.

        Args:
            grid (Grid)
                The Grid object.
            line_ids (list/str)
                A list of line_ids or a str denoting a single line. Doublets
                can be specified as a nested list or using a comma
                (e.g. 'OIII4363,OIII4959').
            fesc (float)
                The Lyman continuum escaped fraction, the fraction of
                ionising photons that entirely escaped.
            tau_v (float)
                V-band optical depth.
            dust_curve (dust_curve)
                A dust_curve object specifying the dust curve.
            mask (array)
                A mask to apply to the particles (only applicable to particle)
            method (str)
                The method to use for the interpolation. Options are:
                'cic' - Cloud in cell
                'ngp' - Nearest grid point
