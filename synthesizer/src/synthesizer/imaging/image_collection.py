"""Defintions for collections of generic images.

This module contains the definition for a generic ImageCollection class. This
provides the common functionality between particle and parametric imaging. The
user should not use this class directly, but rather use the
particle.imaging.Images and parametric.imaging.Images classes.

Example usage:
    # Create an image collection
    img_coll = ImageCollection(resolution=0.1 * unyt.arcsec, npix=100)

    # Get histograms of the particle distribution
    img_coll.get_imgs_hist(photometry, coordinates)

    # Get smoothed images of the particle distribution
    img_coll.get_imgs_smoothed(
        photometry,
        coordinates,
        smoothing_lengths,
        kernel,
        kernel_threshold,
    )

    # Get smoothed images of a parametric distribution
    img_coll.get_imgs_smoothed(
        photometry,
        density_grid=density_grid,
    )

    # Apply PSFs to the images
    img_coll.apply_psfs(psfs)

    # Apply noise to the images
    img_coll.apply_noise_from_stds(noise_stds)

    # Plot the images
    img_coll.plot_images()

    # Make an RGB image
    img_coll.make_rgb_image(rgb_filters, weights)
