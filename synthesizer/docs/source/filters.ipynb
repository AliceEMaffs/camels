    "In synthesizer we encapsulate all filter based functionality in two objects: \n",
    "\n",
    "- A `Filter`: Individual filters with methods and attributes to work with a filters wavelength coverage and transmission.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A `FilterCollection`: A collection of `Filter`s that behaves like a list with extra attributes and methods to efficiently work with multiple `Filter`s.\n",
    "\n",
    "We provide a number of different ways to define a `Filter` or set of `Filter`s:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Generic: A generic filter simply requires a user defined wavelength array and transmission curve to initialise. As such a user can define any arbitrary filter they like using this functionality. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Top Hat: A top hat filter's transmission is 1 in a particular range and 0 everywhere else. These are either defined by a minimum and maximum wavelength of transmission or by the effective wavelength of the transmission and its FWHM.\n",
    "\n",
    "- SVO: We also provide an interface to the SVO filter service (http://svo2.cab.inta-csic.es/theory/fps/). The user need only provide the filter code in \"Observatory/Instrument.code\" format (as shown on SVO) to extract the relevant information from this service and create a `Filter` object."

    "\n",
    "Here we define some wavelengths (in Angstrom) over which we want to define our filters. We can pass this wavelength array to the `Filter` at initialisation and the `Filter`'s tranmission curve will be defined on the passed wavelength array. In practice we would normally use the wavelength array on the `Grid` object to avoid confusion between wavelength arrays on different objects but here we will ignore this. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, it is not required, but it is recommended to initialise a `Filter`/`FilterCollection` with a rest frame wavelength grid (i.e. the `Grid` wavelength array). Although nothing will break if you use an observer frame wavelength grid, the code expects rest frame wavelengths to ensure `*.lam` arrays agree across Synthesizer objects. Any redshifting of `Filter` transmission curves is then handled automatically with minimal overhead. \n",
    "\n",
    "One exception to this rule is when calculating photometry for a large number of objects all at a specific redshift. In that case it is more efficient to use an observer frame wavelength grid on a `Filter`/`FilterCollection` and simply be aware that `Filter.lam` differs from `Grid.lam` and `SED.lam`."
