Synthesizer
===========

Synthesizer is a python package for generating synthetic astrophysical spectra. It is intended to be modular, flexible and fast.

Here are just some examples of what synthesizer can do:

- generate spectra for parametric star formation and metal enrichment
- generate spectra for galaxies from particle-based cosmological hydrodynamic simulations
- measure spectral diagnostics for given spectra
- easily compare stellar population synthesis models
- apply screen dust models to intrinsic spectra

A code paper is currently in preparation. For now please cite `Vijayan et al. 2021 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.501.3289V/abstract>`_ if you use the functionality for producing photometry, and `Wilkins et al. 2020 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.493.6079W/abstract>`_ if you use the line emission functionality.
