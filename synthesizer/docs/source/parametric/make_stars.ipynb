    "- A 2D SFZH grid containing the stellar mass formed in stellar age and metallicity bins.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A `Morphology` object describing it's distribution (optional but required for imaging).\n",

    "- The axes of the SFZH grid.\n",
    "\n",

In what follows we will focus on user defined values/arrays but note that each different method could instead use simulated data (e.g. from Semi Analytic Models) rather than user defined values.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Providing arrays which contain the SFH and metallicity distribution in terms of stellar mass formed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Providing SFH and metallcity distribution functions (from `parametric.sf_hist` and `parametric.metal_dist`). These will be used internally to compute the arrays from the previous point.\n",
