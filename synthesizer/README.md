Synthesizer is a python package for generating synthetic astrophysical spectra. It is intended to be modular, flexible and fast.

Here are just some examples of what synthesizer can do:
- generate spectra for parametric star formation and metal enrichment histories
- generate spectra for galaxies from particle-based cosmological hydrodynamic simulations
- measure spectral diagnostics for given spectra
- easily compare stellar population synthesis models
- apply screen dust models to intrinsic spectra

## Getting Started

First clone the latest version of `synthesizer`

    git clone https://github.com/flaresimulations/synthesizer.git

To install, enter the `synthesizer` directory and install with pip. On unix:

    cd synthesizer
    pip install .

Make sure you stay up to date with the latest versions through git:

    git pull origin main
