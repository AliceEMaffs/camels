"""
Generate lines from parametric galaxy
=====================================

Example for generating a emission lines for a parametric galaxy. This example
will:
- show the available lines to a grid
- build a parametric galaxy (see make_stars and make_sed)
- calculate intrinsic line properties
- calculate dust-attenuated line properties
